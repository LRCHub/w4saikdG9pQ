[00:17.33] Don't go away 逃げ場はない
[00:25.89] Oh why? You're crying 嗤え 狂え
[00:32.99] Coming up, coming up
[00:34.95] 嗚呼 殺意の眼 粋な獲物 昂ぶる 昂ぶる
[00:40.62] Not enough, not enough
[00:42.63] まだその命 愉悦に足りはしない
[00:47.68] We all are the jingoes, oh-oh-oh
[00:52.96] 獣じみた欲を貪れ
[00:56.60] We are in the jungle, oh-oh-oh
[01:00.28] さあ牙を研げ 死の数を競おう ah
[01:19.20] Go on your way 容赦もなく
[01:26.55] No one is left 奪い尽くす
[01:34.24] Showing up, showing up
[01:36.18] 大義と似せたそれは私刑 いたぶる いたぶる
[01:41.48] You're the same, you're the same
[01:43.46] 善と言い張る醜さこそが本性
[01:48.85] We all are the jingoes, oh-oh-oh
[01:53.84] 弱き者を慈悲も残さず
[01:57.42] We are in the jungle, oh-oh-oh
[02:01.09] 喰い尽くすのは 獣より人間の性
[02:12.72] Dance it up, u-ra-ra, dance it up, u-ra-ra, dance it up, u-ra-ra
[02:18.33] O-o-o-o-o-o-o
[02:20.28] Hurry up, i-ya-ya, hurry up, i-ya-ya, hurry up, i-ya-ya
[02:25.65] O-a-o-a-o-a-o
[02:27.75] Dance it up, u-ra-ra, dance it up, u-ra-ra, dance it up, u-ra-ra
[02:33.17] O-o-o-o-o-o-o
[02:35.12] Hurry up, i-ya-ya, hurry up, i-ya-ya, hurry up, i-ya-ya
[02:40.42] O-a-o-a-o-a-o
[02:42.42] The world will be colorful, painful, beautiful
[02:46.34] When your life is lost
[02:49.48] We all are the jingoes, oh-oh-oh
[02:52.94] 獣じみた欲を貪れ
[02:56.54] We are in the jungle, oh-oh-oh
[03:00.36] さあ牙を研げ 死の数を競え
[03:04.25] The jingoes, oh-oh-oh
[03:07.72] 嬲り倒す 味を舐めては
[03:11.31] We are in the jungle, oh-oh-oh
[03:15.02] また舌を出す 狂った人間たちよ ah
[03:25.62] We all are the jingoes, oh-oh-oh
[03:33.79] We are in the jungle, oh-oh-oh
